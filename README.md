## 🐣 **Getting Started**

A few steps showing how to setup the Windwos Terminal in the way previewd in the Screenshots section.

1. **Installing and Configuring the Windows Terminal**
    1. [Install](https://aka.ms/terminal) the Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store.

    2. After successful installation, you need to access the terminal settings by clicking the down-arrow `▼` or by using the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + ,`.

    3. In the `settings.json` file you can update a lot of settings to make the terminal look the way you want it to. Start by checking the [Windows Terminal Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).

    > You also can add different profiles to the Windows Terminal like Git Bash.
    > To add Git Bash to your terminal with an icon you can check the `settings.json` file in this source repository and you can copy the profile.  
    > ⚠ Warning: Make sure you delete or change the path of the `"BackgroundImage:` attribute if you copy the code from the file.
